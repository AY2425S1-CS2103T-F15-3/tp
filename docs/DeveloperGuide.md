### Architecture

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/developer-guide-images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonPane`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/developer-guide-images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PROpertyParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PROpertyParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PROpertyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PROperty`, which `Person` references. This allows `PROperty` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PROpertyStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
    
### Sort Feature


The sort feature in `PROperty` is implemented by adding sorting methods to the `UniquePersonList` class, which is responsible for managing the list of `Person` objects. Sorting is performed directly on the `internalList` by specific attributes such as `name` or `ID`, allowing users to organise contacts in a meaningful order.

The feature includes the following operations:

- **`UniquePersonList#sortByName()`** â€” Sorts the `internalList` of `Person` objects alphabetically by name, using a `Comparator` that performs a case-insensitive comparison.
- **`UniquePersonList#sortByID()`** â€” Sorts the `internalList` by ID in ascending order, allowing users to organise contacts based on their unique identifiers.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortByName()` and `Model#sortByID()` respectively.


The following sequence diagram shows how an sort operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide-images//SortSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Similarly, the sorting process within the `Model` component is shown below:

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Property Agents who type fast

Their responsibilities include managing a large list of property listings,
coordinating with clients and potential buyers, conducting property viewings, negotiating deals,
and handling paperwork related to real estate transactions. They are often mobile, needing quick and easy
access to information, and manage a large client and property database.

**Value proposition**:
Agents often have difficulty keeping track of the large client and property database.
Our address book allows property agents to manage prospective and existing customers by sorting them into
different categories including housing type and income level.
Moreover, they can keep track of house visits via an events management system.

* Allows property agents to manage prospective and existing customers easily by sorting them into different
  categories such as by housing type, income level, rent/sell/buy
* Agents can sort by customer status: unresponsive,
* Keep track of the various landlords who own the houses
* Easy for agent to remember who to try to sell unit to
* Events for scheduling visits to houses - reminders for agents when they open the app on any upcoming visits

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

- **Reminder/Event**: A scheduled notification linked to a contact, alerting the user of upcoming tasks, appointments, or follow-ups.

- **Social Media Handles**: Usernames or profile links associated with a person's social media accounts.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: A feature that displays commands in different colors to differentiate between commands, attributes, and values for easier readability.

## **Appendix B: Planned Enhancements**

As we continue to develop PROperty, we are focused on refining and expanding its capabilities to better meet user needs. 
Through identifying current limitations, weâ€™re able to target areas that can benefit most from enhancement. 
This section highlights our planned improvements, showcasing the steps we're taking to deliver a more comprehensive and effective solution for property agents.


### Enhance Phone Numbers to Accept Special Characters

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

At present, phone numbers only accept numeric characters, excluding symbols such as `+` and dashes `-`. 
However, these characters are essential for supporting country and area codes, and dashes can improve readability by 
separating sections of a phone number (e.g., `+1-800-9087-2029`).

**Proposed Enhancement**

We plan to modify the phone number field to allow `+` symbols and dashes `-` so users can input phone numbers with country/area codes 
and use dashes for better readability. This enhancement will provide greater flexibility and accommodate a wider range of valid phone number formats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix C: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
