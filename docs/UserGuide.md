PROperty is a **desktop app for property agents managing contacts and their property listings,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, PROperty can get your contact and property management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

PROperty is useful for property agents because it saves their time by allowing easy tracking of contacts,
and easily filtering them according to tailor-made categories relevant to property agents in Singapore. It is much
simpler to use while being even more functional than alternatives on the market.

## Quick start

### Step 1: Check if Your Computer is Ready
First, we need to make sure your computer has Java 17 installed. Here's how to check:

1. Open your computer's terminal:
   - **For Windows**: Press the Windows key + R, type `cmd`, and press Enter
   - **For Mac**: Press Command + Space, type `terminal`, and press Enter
2. In the black terminal window that appears, type exactly:
   ```
   java --version
   ```
   and press Enter
3. What you should see:
   - ✅ If you see "java 17" or "openjdk 17" (or any number above 17), you're ready to go!
   - ❌ If you see "command not found" or a number below 17, visit [Java's download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) to install Java 17

### Step 2: Install PROperty

1. Download PROperty:
   - Click [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/releases) to download the latest PROperty
   - Look for the file named `PROperty.jar` and click on it to download
2. Create a home folder for PROperty:
   - Create a new folder on your computer named `PROperty`
   - Copy the downloaded `PROperty.jar` file into this folder
3. Start PROperty:
   - Double-click on the `PROperty.jar` file to run it
     **For advanced users:** Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar PROperty.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   - You should see the PROperty window appear as follows below! Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/user-guide-images/Ui.png)

### Step 3: Try Your First Commands

Now that PROperty is running, let's try using the different commands available. All you have to do is to type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. 
Some example commands you can try are:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a client named `John Doe` to PROperty.


* `edit 1 n/Mary Jane p/12345678 e/maryj@example.com a/Mary street, block 321, #02-02` : Edits the client with index 1 in PROperty.


* `listing add 2 t/HDB a/Adam street, block 456, #03-03` : Adds a listing for the client with index 2 in PROperty.


Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/seller` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/seller`, `t/seller t/landlord` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PROperty will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the PROperty to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: To transfer your data to another computer, follow these steps:

1. **Install PROperty**: Place the `PROperty.jar` file in your preferred location on the new computer.
2. **Set Up the Data Folder**: If you have already run the application, skip to step 3. Otherwise, manually create a `data` folder in the same directory as `PROperty.jar`.
3. **Transfer Your Data**: If the application has been run previously, simply replace the existing `property.json` file in the `data` folder with your data-containing `property.json` file from the original computer. Otherwise, add your `property.json` file directly into the `data` folder you just created.
4. **Launch PROperty**: Run the app to load your transferred data, giving you access to all your previous clients and property listings.


**Q**: Can I customise the tags or categories for clients and properties?<br>
**A**: Customising tags is not currently supported. Users can only use the predefined tags listed in the table provided in this guide.

**Q**: Is there a way to restore a deleted client?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, it is not possible to restore a deleted client. We strongly recommend that you regularly save a backup of your clients to prevent accidental data loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
