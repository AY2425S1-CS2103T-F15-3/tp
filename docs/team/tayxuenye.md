### Project: PROperty

PROperty is a desktop address book application specialised for property agents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a remark for each contact.
  * What it does: Allows the user to associate miscellaneous information to a contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the flexibility of how the user wishes to store information of a contact because the format needed may not conform to what is available.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: Guided by CS2103T Week 6 Tutorial 2.
